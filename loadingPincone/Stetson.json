I learned how to create in text citations today and that was the first time anyone has tried to show me how to do it step by step. My other professors just tell me to do it, they do not show me how To do it. I feel prepared.Participation mattersInspirationalRespectedHelpful00",

If you ask for help, it's there but he's not going to go out of his way for you. His pace is moderate to fast and is lecture based. He tries to get a few group discussions, but they are limited to at least 2 throughout the semester. I personally did not like him nor did I enjoy his class.Helpful00"
